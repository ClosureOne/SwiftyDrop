[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a centralised dependency manager that automates the process of adding libraries to your Cocoa application. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem update
$ gem install cocoapods
$ pods --version
```

To integrate TouchVisualizer into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile` and run `pod install`.

```bash
platform :ios, '8.1'
use_frameworks!
pod "SwiftyDrop", '~>0.0.1'
```
